# Code to pull tweets a la week 9's breakout session

breakout.py relies on a "creds.py" file with your twitter creds in it.
It's formatted as you'd expect:

	consumer_key = "<key-goes-here>"
	consumer_secret = "<secret-goes-here>"

	access_token = "<token-goes-here>"
	access_token_secret = "<token-secret-goes-here>"
